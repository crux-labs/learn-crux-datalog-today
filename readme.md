# Learn Crux Datalog Today

The `master.md` file can be uploaded directly to [Nextjournal](https://nextjournal.com) via the UI when creating a new Notebook. Once uploaded, you need to manually name the code cell containing the deps.edn configuration map "deps.edn" (using the context menu on the LHS of the snippet) and then configure the Clojure Runtime (by accessing the Clojure Runtime Settings on the sidebar menu) to accept this file using the "Add mount" option and selecting `deps.edn` from the dropdown. You should then be able to "Save changes & start" and begin evaluating the code cells one-by-one or use fast-forward button to execute the entire Notebook.

See the project board for ideas, actions and WIP.
