# Learn Crux Datalog Today

Learn Crux Datalog Today is derived from the classic [learndatalogtoday.org](http://learndatalogtoday.org) tutorial materials, but adapted to focus on the [Crux](https://opencrux.com) API and unique Datalog semantics.

## Quickstart

https://nextjournal.com/try/deo/learn-crux-datalog-today-3 - try the tutorial!

Use the "Run All" button at the top or the "Run Cell" buttons beside each Clojure snippet to execute the samples.
Be careful, this is a live document and you can edit anything. You can always reload the page if you make a mistake. :)

## Installation

1. Create a new account on [Nextjournal](https://nextjournal.com).
2. Download [master.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crux-labs/learn-crux-datalog-today/master/master.md).
3. Click "+ NEW" to create a new notebook on the [Nextjournal Dashboard](https://nextjournal.com/dashboard).
4. At the bottom of the page, choose "Import: Select a Markdown file to import" and upload `master.md` you downloaded in Step 2.
Do not use "Import from a (GitHub) URL" -- it will not work.
5. Once imported, scroll down to the EDN block which begins with `{:deps ...` under "Runtime Setup".
Hover your cursor over this EDN block and an ellipsis ("...") will appear on the lefthand side.
Click the ellipsis.
Choose "Assign Name" and enter `deps.edn`.
6. Open the Clojure Runtime Settings by clicking "Runtimes: Clojure" in the lefthand sidebar.
Scroll down to "Mounts" and click "+ Add mount".
Select `deps.edn`.
Click "Save changes and start" in the dialog that appears at the top.

You can now try the tutorial!
Use the "Run All" button at the top or the "Run Cell" buttons beside each Clojure snippet to execute the samples.
